# FinalProject

For my final project, I plan to create my three drawings around a Korean variety show called "Running Man." It is a television show that I have watched as a child, and it is still airing today. Each drawing will be dedicated to a favorite episode of mine. Each of the drawings will contain two to four of the best moments of each episode. The moments will be short video clips that will be activated by user interaction. The video clips will be displayed neatly, adjacent to one another. I plan to keep each drawing will be video-centric with little to no background activity (i.e. images, collages, etc.). This is to keep an element of simplicity and direct the attention to the videos. The show is humorous and often themed, so for certain episodes I may have to include a simple background image or color to let the viewers get a better sense of what the episode was about. Because two to four short clips will most likely not be able to encapsulate the entire episode, I may find it necessary to include background. I will need to use HTML to lay a template for each page/drawing, CSS to design the look and feel of each page/drawing, and Javascript to animate and make each page/drawing interactive.
